# Problem Statement
Car fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions have been a topic of significant concern in recent years, as the transportation sector is one of the major contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions.
The engine emissions from cars can be attributed to several components of the vehicle, including the engine, transmission, exhaust system, and weight. There is a need to understand the car components responsible for CO2 emissions, the impact of these emissions on the environment, and potential solutions for reducing emissions from these components. 

In this project, we will be exploring the relationship between car components of various brands, fuel efficiency and environmental impacts. This is identify the most fuel-efficient car brands and reduce the environmental impact of car manufacturing while maintaining high engine performance.
