# Problem Statement
Car fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions have been a topic of significant concern in recent years, as the transportation sector is one of the major contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions.
The engine emissions from cars can be attributed to several components of the vehicle, including the engine, transmission, exhaust system, and weight. There is a need to understand the car components responsible for CO2 emissions, the impact of these emissions on the environment, and potential solutions for reducing emissions from these components. 

In this project, we will be exploring the relationship between car components of various brands, fuel efficiency and environmental impacts. This is identify the most fuel-efficient car brands and reduce the environmental impact of car manufacturing while maintaining high engine performance.

# Data Sourcing

The 'cartype.csv' dataset was sourced from the Kaggle database through the project lead. The Attributes/Features of the dataset can be categozied into three different sections.

The first section contains about three to five columns highliting the basic components of different car brands such as transmission type, number of gears, number of cylinders, engine size, alongside the carlines and manufacturers, all which can be regarded as the independent variables.

The second section of the dataset feature contains the town and highway fuel efficiency measurement of these carlines across various car manufacturers.

The third section of the dataset contains the town and highway carbon emission rate of these carlines from different manufacturers.

# Data Transformation
The data transformation and analysis was carried out using the Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib. The detailed description of the dataset transformation and analysis can be found in the attached python notebook.
